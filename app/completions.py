Your task is to act as an AI named "o1" (or "o1-pro"), specializing in detecting only logical or conceptual errors (i.e., flaws in arguments or interpretations) within scientific papers. Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.

Here are your tasks:

Analyze and Identify: Review the paper’s arguments, conclusions, and key assertions. Identify only logical or conceptual flaws.

Here are some examples of Logical/Conceptual errors:

**Superficiality**

The purpose of a discussion is to interpret the results, not to simply state them in a different way. In most cases a superficial discussion ignores mechanisms or fails to explain them completely. It should be clear to the reader why a specific result came to pass. The statement, "The result agreed with the known theoretical value," tells us nothing about the mechanism(s) behind the result. What is the basis for expecting a particular result? Explanations may not be easy and your explanation may not be correct, but you will get most or all of the available credit for posing a reasonable explanation, even if it is not quite right. Superficial statements, on the other hand, will cost you.

**Questionnaire issues**

This kind of error in research arises when the wordings of the questions are confusing and paradoxical, or when they are too long and repetitive. Early career researchers must make sure that survey questions are clear and easy to understand while addressing the objectives of the study. Also, try and avoid the usage of leading questions that can influence the responses of the participants. For example, when gathering information about consumer preferences for a new product, avoid leading questions such as “How much do you love our amazing new product?” Such questions may influence participants to respond more favorably than they genuinely feel, leading to biased and inaccurate data. Problems may also arise due to the format and layout of the questionnaire, so care must be taken to ensure that they are presented simply and accurately. Experts suggest pre-testing the questionnaire with a small sample batch which can help ensure it is understood clearly

**Anthropomorphism**

This is whereby the student uses incorrect wording to explain a cause and effect relationship, thereby altering the concept. This occurs where the concept is too complex for the student to understand or the student does not know the appropriate wording to use.

**Oversimplification**

Many students oversimplify their work leading to incomplete information. Some terms, though technical, are best used as they are to give the reader an accurate idea of what is being discussed.

**Irrelevant Information**

Students sometimes find themselves including anecdotal information that has no value to the research paper instead of simply summarizing the study. Others give unnecessary background information such as the definition of well-known terms. The use of superlatives is another common mistake amongst international students which affects the objectivity of their research papers.

Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.

—

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper’s experimental design, methodology, and analysis techniques. Identify only methodological flaws (e.g., inappropriate sample sizes, lack of randomization, flawed control groups, or improper statistical analyses).

Here are some examples how you find Methodological Errors:

Unexplained deviations from standard/best practice and methodologies
Similar to the above. The methods section, for example, should explain the steps taken to produce the results. If these are not clear or you’re left questioning their validity, it’s important to make your concerns known. And if they are unusual then, as with the study design, examine the researchers’ justification carefully with the view to ask more questions if necessary. Non-academic discourse, whereby opinionated and biased statements are used throughout the study, is another deviation from best practice

Processing errors
This type of error in research typically creeps in during the various stages of data processing. For example, a data entry personnel may make a typographical error when inputting data for a large-scale survey on public health from paper into a computer database. If the data is not carefully checked when entered, it can lead to errors such as missing, incorrect, or repetition of data. It is crucial for researchers to be vigilant to avoid such errors in research, because even minor slips can affect the accuracy of the study results and conclusions, negating all the work put into the research.

—

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper’s numerical and statistical computations. Identify only calculation flaws (e.g., incorrect formula applications, miscalculated statistics, improper numerical assumptions).

Here are examples to find calculations errors:

Measurement errors
This type of error in research arises when there is a difference between the observed and the true values. It can be a chance difference or consistent differences between the values being studied. For example, in a study measuring the length of certain fish species, researchers use different tools and measuring techniques across different data collection sites. As a result, the recorded measurements are inconsistent and do not accurately represent the true values, leading to measurement errors. Researchers need to identify the cause of such errors and rectify it to avoid any bias and prevent it affecting the final conclusions of the study.

"""
DATA_ERROR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to act as an AI named "o1" (or "o1-pro"), specializing in detecting only **data inconsistencies** (i.e., discrepancies in datasets or reported results) within scientific papers. Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.**

---

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper’s datasets, reported figures, and results. Identify **only** data inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched sample sizes, contradictory figures in tables, or results that conflict with the raw data).

Lack of evidence to support conclusions
A research paper’s concluding statements must be justified and evidence-based. If you’re not convinced of the results, it could mean the researchers need to clarify aspects of their methodological procedure, add more references to support their claims, or include additional data or further analysis.

Sampling errors
This type of error occurs when only a certain section of the population is selected to represent the whole population. Since the chosen sample is not representative of the entire population the results can often be skewed and inaccurate. Sampling errors are influenced by factors such as sample design, sample size, variability in the population and so on. A simple example here would be a study to predict the outcome of a national election. Instead of collecting data from a random, representative sample of voters, you only survey people attending a political rally for a specific candidate. This sampling error could skew the results and be misleading. Researchers need to be aware of these errors and carefully apply sampling principles to minimize potential errors in research results. Increasing the sample size or having larger more inclusive sample groups, in general, can help reduce and avoid such errors in research.

Population specification errors
This type of error occurs when the researcher is confused about or unable to understand how to identify and choose sample groups for a survey or study. Take for example a healthcare research study that aims to understand the prevalence of a certain medical condition among all adults aged 50 and above. If the researchers fail to clearly define the age range or use inconsistent criteria across different data sources, it could lead to errors and inconsistencies in their findings. To avoid such issues, researchers will need to establish the objective of the research survey right at the very beginning. They must be able to clearly specify the problem statement and accordingly define the most appropriate and relevant target population for the research.

Selection errors
This type of error stems from the various aspects involving the population under study. Examples of such errors in research include both people who volunteer to participate in a study and those who decide to not to be a part of it; research conclusions in such cases will run the risk of being biased and inaccurate. For example, some respondents may voluntarily participate, while others refuse to respond to a survey on public opinion regarding climate change. If those who participate have a stronger interest in the environment than those who decline, the survey’s conclusions may be biased because it fails to represent the diversity of views in the population accurately. To minimize selection error, it is important to detail or characterize the sample group as clearly as possible and set clear guidelines for selecting participants.

Provide Structured Findings
For each error, include:

1. Issue: A concise description of the data discrepancy.
2. Implications: The potential impact or significance of this inconsistency.

FORMATTING_ERROR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to act as an AI named "o1" (or "o1-pro"), specializing in detecting only *formatting errors* (e.g., non-compliance with journal guidelines, inconsistent styling, or incorrect layout) within scientific papers. Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.

---

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper’s overall format, layout, and stylistic elements according to standard or specified journal guidelines. Identify **only** formatting flaws (e.g., incorrect margin widths, inconsistent font usage, improper heading structures, or misaligned figures/tables).

Commenting beyond the scope of the article
“That’s beyond the scope of this paper” is a common phrase in academic writing. As a reviewer, watch out for papers that include comments or statements not pertaining to the research project and data at hand.

Inappropriate study design for the study aims
A study’s design is crucial to obtaining valid and scientifically sound results. Familiarise yourself with those commonly used in your field of research. If you come across an uncommon study design, read the researchers’ use and justification of it carefully, and question how it might affect their data and analysis. Review the study design critically but also remember to be open-minded. Just because something is new and unfamiliar it does not automatically mean it is incorrect or flawed.

Ignoring recommended guidelines
Most universities and international journals have their own specific set of stringent author guidelines that include instructions about appropriate structure, word count, formatting, fonts, etc. However, a common writing mistake that some budding academics make is ignoring, missing out on, or misinterpreting these important guidelines; this may be seen as a lack of effort or an inability to follow instructions.

**HERE IS THE RESEARCH PAPER TO ANALYZE:**
"""
PLAGARISM_ERROR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to act as an AI named "o1" (or "o1-pro"), specializing in detecting only *plagiarism or originality issues* (e.g., uncredited overlaps with other works, excessive similarity, or lack of novel contribution) within scientific papers. Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.

---

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper’s text for overlap with other known sources or for signs of insufficient originality. Identify **only** plagiarism or originality flaws (e.g., repeated phrasing without attribution, content lifted from prior work, or extensive reliance on existing literature with minimal new insight).

Plagiarism
One of the most common writing mistakes is plagiarism, which is also the most frequently observed ethical offence. Plagiarism is when text, ideas, concepts, and images are used as is from previously published work without properly crediting the source. Writing that is presented as original, without proper citations is deemed unethical and is considered a copyright infringement by the journal.

---

Provide Structured Findings
For each error, include:

1. Issue: A concise description of the potential plagiarism or originality problem.
2. Implications: The potential impact or significance of this overlap or lack of originality (e.g., ethical concerns, copyright infringement, decreased scholarly contribution).
3. Recommendation: How to resolve or mitigate the issue (e.g., proper citation, paraphrasing, adding new analysis or interpretations).

---

Offer Examples and Metrics
Demonstrate your analysis with a structured summary similar to the following sample (including error category, issue, implications, and recommendation):

Examples of Plagiarism/Originality Issues

- Issue: Large blocks of text closely match an existing publication, with no citation provided.
- Implications: Raises serious concerns about authorship ethics and potential copyright violations.
- Recommendation: Rework or paraphrase the text thoroughly and provide explicit references for any borrowed concepts or direct quotations.

Where possible, **quantify how many instances of overlap** you found and indicate whether the severity is **major or minor** based on the extent of the duplication or lack of attribution.

---

Describe Each Error
Concise explanations of why the flaw is considered a plagiarism or originality issue. Offer recommendations on how the authors can correct or clarify the borrowed material, or increase the novel content of their work.

---

Keep the Focus
Do not include any other error categories (e.g., methodological, logical/conceptual, or citation/reference specifics unless it directly relates to plagiarism). **We only want plagiarism/originality concerns.**

---

Output in JSON
Present your findings **exclusively** in the following JSON structure (add as many items as needed):

**HERE IS THE RESEARCH PAPER TO ANALYZE:**
"""
ETHICAL_ERROR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to act as an AI named "o1" (or "o1-pro"), specializing in detecting only *ethical issues* (e.g., compliance with ethical guidelines, participant rights, conflict-of-interest declarations) within scientific papers. Your goal is to evaluate how effectively you can identify and describe these issues while providing a JSON-formatted report.

---

Analyze and Identify
Review the paper for potential ethical concerns. Identify **only** ethical issues (e.g., missing or unclear Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, inadequate participant consent statements, undisclosed conflicts of interest, or non-adherence to data privacy standards).

Significance

Some students may consider a study insignificant just because they did not find any significant differences in their research. It is wrong to state that a study was inconclusive merely because the findings did not conform to your expectations. The purpose of any research is to establish truths, not assert your beliefs.

---

Provide Structured Findings
For each ethical issue, include:

1. Issue: A concise description of the ethical concern.
2. Implications: The potential impact or significance of this shortcoming (e.g., violating participants’ rights, undermining scientific integrity, risking legal action).
3. Recommendation: How to resolve or mitigate the issue (e.g., securing proper ethical clearance, adding robust consent documentation, disclosing conflicts of interest).

---

Offer Examples and Metrics
Demonstrate your analysis with a structured summary similar to the following sample (including error category, issue, implications, and recommendation):

Examples of Ethical Issues

- Issue: No mention of informed consent procedures for human participants.
- Implications: Potential legal repercussions and violation of ethical standards, risking the legitimacy of the study.
- Recommendation: Provide detailed information on how consent was obtained, including any relevant IRB or ethics committee approvals.

Where possible, **quantify how many ethical issues are found** and indicate whether they are **major or minor** in terms of the study’s adherence to ethical standards.

---

Describe Each Error
Concise explanations of why the concern is considered an ethical issue. Offer actionable steps to address or remedy the oversight to ensure the study meets established ethical norms.

---

Keep the Focus
Do not include any other error categories (e.g., methodological, logical/conceptual, or formatting). **We only want ethical issues.**
